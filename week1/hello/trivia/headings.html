            As a company, I have a great deal of time for Cisco Systems.
            Basically, they help build the foundation of the Internet,
            and they still provide the majority of the core networking infastructure.
            And, for video conferencing, they had the opportunity to rise up and become a world leader.
            So, as the pandemic happened, Cisco Webex was probably in a prime position to take a large part of the video conferencing market.

            At the start of the pandemic (Spring 2020), Microsoft was nowhere in the video conferencing market, and was struggling to scale its Skype software into a video conferencing world. Basically, Skype had focused on speech and linking to telephones, and generally struggled with v
            ideo conferencing. Microsoft also had SharePoint, and which lacked any real integration with video conferencing.
